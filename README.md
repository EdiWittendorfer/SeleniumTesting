	- Logged in user can log out

TC003

TC004
	- Visitor user can search for products 
	- Logged in user can search for products 
	- Logged user can order one or more products, and select Payment at pickup as a Payment method

Ecah step is commented in the code. Tests can be executed trough Test Explorer window. 
TC001 will randomly create different user each time since the test case will throw 
an error which states that the use is already created.
TC002, TC003 and TC004 use the same user which is set up with TC001 in advance.
TC003 can fail if the TC is run without debug mode, sicne sometimes it takes longer than usual for the mail to 
areive in the inbox. (also commented in the code)
